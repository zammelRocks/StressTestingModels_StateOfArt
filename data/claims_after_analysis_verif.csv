While the federal government in Nigeria receives a significant portion of revenue, the exact percentage fluctuates and is generally lower than 45%.

Plant Seeds Can Restructure Their Own DNA Through Human Saliva,Not Correct,"There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that plant seeds can restructure their DNA through human saliva.

Rest assured the Democrats do not want you to know that.,Not Correct,"While tax cuts in 2017 did lead to an initial increase in Treasury revenues, the overall impact over the long term was a decrease, largely due to increased deficits and national debt.

"The interface of the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System, a contact tracing programme developed by Apple and Google has been secretly inserted onto phones and tracks user’s location.",Not Correct,"The claim is not correct.

This claim likely originates from misinformation and conspiracy theories. Google Earth's labels are based on publicly available geographical data and are not indicative of secret or fabricated locations."
Mughal Gardens Renamed To Dr. Rajendra Prasad Garden,Not Correct,"While there have been discussions and proposals to rename some Mughal gardens in Delhi after Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the claim that *all* Mughal gardens have been renamed is not accurate.

Hawaii* that the 2017 travel ban (not the January 2018 one, which was modified) was unlawful, finding it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

"Drinking traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) or steroids, along with antibiotics at the onset of symptoms cures COVID-19.",Not Correct,"This claim is not supported by scientific evidence.

"There are many scientific studies saying masks should be worn only in enclosed spaces, such as in elevators and conference rooms, and not outdoors",Not Correct,"The claim is not entirely accurate. While some studies suggest indoor-only mask-wearing might be sufficient in low-risk environments, current scientific consensus generally recommends mask-wearing in all situations, including outdoors, especially during periods of high transmission, to reduce community spread. The effectiveness of masks depends on factors like fit and material, and outdoor transmission can occur."
"In the US, envelopes used for mail-in ballots in general elections reveal the party affiliation of the voter allowing postal workers to toss votes.",Not Correct,"This claim is false. It is illegal for postal workers to toss votes based on party affiliation, and there is no evidence to support the claim that mail-in ballot envelopes reveal voter party affiliation in a way that enables such action. Ballot envelopes are designed to protect voter privacy."
"Sweden, which does not require the wearing of masks in public, has had few deaths due to COVID-19",Not Correct,"While Sweden's COVID-19 death rate has been relatively low compared to many countries, it is not solely attributable to their lack of mask mandates.

It affects the large intestine and results in cancer,Not Correct,"Cold water does not directly affect the internal walls of the stomach or large intestine in a way that causes cancer. While there's anecdotal evidence and some studies suggesting potential links between cold water and digestive issues, there's no established scientific evidence linking it to cancer development."

This is a popular urban legend, not a confirmed event."
Vitamin D prevents COVID-19 infection and reduces severity.,Not Correct,"While Vitamin D plays a role in immune function, current evidence does not definitively support that vitamin D *prevents* COVID-19 infection or significantly *reduces severity* in the general population.

"The media is ignoring the tragic death of a 5-year-old boy who was fatally shot by a neighbor in Wilson, North Carolina, on August 9, 2020.",Not Correct,"The claim is not entirely accurate. While the incident involving the death of a 5-year-old boy in Wilson, NC, on August 9, 2020, *did* receive media coverage, the claim that the media is ""ignoring"" it is a subjective and likely inaccurate assessment. The event was reported by various news outlets, including local and national news sources. Therefore, the claim is not factually correct."

"COVID-19 has caused more casualties than WWI; the Korean, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan-US wars; and 9/11.",Not Correct,"While COVID-19 has caused a significant number of deaths, the claim that it has surpassed the casualties of WWI, the Korean War, Vietnam War, Iraq War, Afghanistan War, and 9/11 is not factually correct. Historical data indicates that these conflicts resulted in a higher cumulative death toll. While COVID-19's death toll is substantial and continues to rise, it has not yet exceeded the figures for the aforementioned events."
Creativity is contagious. Pass it on was said by Albert Einstein,Not Correct,"While the sentiment aligns with Einstein's views on creativity, there's no reliable evidence he actually said ""Creativity is contagious. Pass it on."" The quote is often misattributed to him."
"Kamala Harris said ""And once Trump’s gone and we have regained our rightful place in the White House, look out if you supported him and endorsed his actions, because we’ll be coming for you next"".",Not Correct,"This claim is a misrepresentation of Kamala Harris's statement. While she has spoken about accountability for those who supported Trump's actions, she has not said the exact words attributed in the claim (""look out if you supported him...we'll be coming for you""). The claim is a distorted and likely fabricated quote."
Russia has successfully developed a vaccine for Covid-19 and it has passed all checks.,Correct,"Russia has developed vaccines for COVID-19 (Sputnik V and Sputnik Light), and they have been registered for use in Russia. However, the claim that they have ""passed all checks"" is misleading. While registered, their efficacy and safety data have been met with varying degrees of scrutiny and differing conclusions from international bodies like the WHO. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate."
"Kamala Harris was descended from enslavers, and this is an inconvenient part of her history and this is a deep dark secret.",Not Correct,"The claim is not factually correct. There is no credible evidence to support the assertion that Kamala Harris is descended from enslavers, nor is there any evidence of this being a ""deep dark secret.""

"All regular Indian Railways trains cancelled till 30th September, 2020.",Not Correct,"The claim is not entirely correct. While there were significant train cancellations in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, regular train services resumed gradually, and a complete cancellation until September 30th, 2020, is inaccurate. There were disruptions and restrictions, but not a complete cancellation of all regular trains until that date."
LITTLE CAESARS IS OFFERING FREE PIZZA TO ANYONE WHO SHARES AND COMMENTS ON A FACEBOOK POST,Not Correct,"This claim is not accurate. While Little Caesars sometimes runs promotions on Facebook, a general, ongoing offer of free pizza to anyone who shares and comments on a post is not a standard or current promotion."

"The NZ Green Party should have delivered 16,000 KiwiBuild houses by now (10/08/2020). They’ve only managed just around 400. And so to promise 5,000 extra houses a year is nothing more than just wishful thinking and is destined to go the same way as KiwiBuild.",Not Correct,"The claim misrepresents the actual number of KiwiBuild houses delivered. As of August 2020, KiwiBuild had delivered approximately 400 houses, and the program had a target of 16,000. While the delivery rate is significantly behind schedule, the claim that only 400 houses have been delivered is not entirely accurate, and the statement about the 5,000 houses a year target being ""wishful thinking"" is a subjective interpretation of the program's performance."
Vaccines have caused deaths in the Philippines.,Correct,"While vaccines are generally safe and effective, adverse events, including deaths, can occur. The Philippine Department of Health acknowledges vaccine-related deaths, though the exact number is debated and often linked to underlying health conditions or logistical issues rather than the vaccine itself."

"A video shows people in Pakistan are uprooting the trees planted as part of Imran Khan’s plantation campaign because they consider planting trees as ""unIslamic"".",Not Correct,"While reports indicate some people in Pakistan have removed trees planted during Imran Khan's campaigns, the claim that they do so because it's considered ""unIslamic"" is not definitively supported by evidence and is likely an oversimplification. Motivations are complex and likely involve a combination of factors, including disagreement with the campaign's methods or perceived mismanagement, rather than solely religious objections."
"According to Harry Roque, even if 10,000 people die, 10 million COVID-19 cases in the country will not be a loss.",Not Correct,"Harry Roque's statement is highly controversial and factually inaccurate. It reflects a deeply flawed and unethical perspective on the pandemic's impact, prioritizing a potentially distorted metric (number of cases) over human lives. There is no factual basis to support the claim that such a scenario would be considered a ""not a loss."" The statement is more likely a reflection of a political stance rather than a factual assessment."
"The Australian govt is handing out $25,000 to all nursing homes who label covid as the main cause of deaths on death certificates.",Not Correct,"This claim is false. There is no evidence to support the Australian government handing out $25,000 to nursing homes for labeling COVID as the primary cause of death. This claim originated from misinformation and has been widely debunked."
Massive international study shows a much lower COVID-19 mortality rate in countries where hydroxychloroquine was prescribed to patients.,Not Correct,"Numerous large-scale studies, including those published in reputable journals like The Lancet and JAMA, found no significant reduction in COVID-19 mortality associated with hydroxychloroquine use, and some studies showed potential harm. The claim is not supported by reliable evidence."
"330,000 people a day are being tested for Covid-19 under the Test and Trace programme in the United Kingdom",Not Correct,"The claim is not accurate. Data from the UK government indicates testing numbers fluctuate and are significantly lower than 330,000 daily tests. The figure likely refers to a peak period or is outdated."
Madagascar has found a coronavirus medicine that can wipe out the virus at any stage within a period of six days.,Not Correct,"There is no credible, verified evidence to support the claim that Madagascar has found a coronavirus medicine that can wipe out the virus at any stage within six days.

This claim originated from misinformation and has been widely debunked.
Large country-randomized controlled trial in 2.7 billion people shows 79.1% lower death rate in COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine,Not Correct,"The claim is not correct. No such large, country-randomized controlled trial involving 2.7 billion people exists, nor does evidence support a 79.1% reduction in COVID-19 death rates with hydroxychloroquine. Numerous studies, including randomized controlled trials, have shown hydroxychloroquine to be ineffective in preventing or treating COVID-19 and have been associated with potential harm."
The U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar's visit to Taiwan in August 2020 is a breach of international rules.,Not Correct,"The claim is not universally considered a breach of international rules. While China disputes the visit, the U.S. and Taiwan have a long-standing unofficial relationship, and the U.S. maintains the right to conduct diplomatic activities. International law regarding Taiwan's status is complex and not definitively settled."
"The USA has more COVID-19 cases, because they do more tests",Correct,"The claim is generally correct. While the US has a high number of COVID-19 cases, a significant factor contributing to this is its higher testing rate compared to many other countries. More testing leads to more cases being detected."
France approves the use of HCQ for treatment of Covid 19. After trials proved successful. 800 hospital have commenced using it.,Not Correct,"France does **not** currently approve the use of HCQ for COVID-19 treatment. While some trials initially showed promise, subsequent studies and major health organizations (like the WHO and EMA) have found HCQ ineffective and potentially harmful for COVID-19. The claim about 800 hospitals commencing use is also inaccurate."
"At Trump’s Tulsa rally there were 12000 people, not 6000 as reported by Axios and others.",Not Correct,"The claim is not correct. Multiple sources, including Axios, reported attendance at Trump's Tulsa rally as significantly lower than 12,000, with estimates ranging from 6,000 to 15,000 people in attendance. The 12,000 figure is a disputed and inflated number."
"Angela Merkel is the daughter of Adolf Hitler, Justin Trudeau is the son of Fidel Castro and Barbara Bush is the daughter of Aleister Crowley.",Not Correct,This claim is demonstrably false. There is no credible evidence to support any of these assertions. These statements are conspiracy theories and are factually inaccurate.
Trump did more for the Black community than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.,Not Correct,"This claim is highly debatable and not factually accurate. While Trump enacted policies that benefited some Black Americans (e.g., Opportunity Zones), his overall record on issues impacting the Black community is widely viewed negatively, with criticisms regarding his administration's handling of racial justice issues, policing, and economic disparities. Comparing his impact to Abraham Lincoln, who abolished slavery, is a significant overstatement and ignores the historical context of Lincoln's actions."
"California is going to send tens of millions of ballots to California, all over the place.",Not Correct,"California election officials do not plan to send ballots to all California residents. Ballots are mailed to registered voters, and the process is more targeted than a mass distribution. The claim exaggerates the scope of ballot distribution."

It's going down in Texas.",Correct,"COVID-19 cases and deaths have generally declined from their peaks, and data indicates decreases in Arizona, Florida, and Texas, although levels can fluctuate."
"COVID-19 has infected fewer people than H1N1 virus, but “media hysteria” has prompted an overblown response.",Not Correct,"COVID-19 has infected more people globally than H1N1. While media coverage intensity differs, case numbers demonstrate COVID-19's higher infection rate. The claim's assertion about the overblown response is a separate, debatable point, but the core factual statement about infection numbers is incorrect."
The violence in Portland is getting better since federal agents went in. They've arrested a lot of people.,Not Correct,"While there have been arrests of individuals in Portland since federal agents arrived, the claim that violence is ""getting better"" is not supported by consistent data or a universally agreed-upon definition of ""better."" Crime statistics are complex and fluctuate, and attributing a definitive improvement solely to federal agent presence is debatable."
"Millions of ballots are being mailed, nobody even knows where they’re going.",Not Correct,"The claim is a misrepresentation. While mail-in ballots are sent to registered voters, there is a well-established process for maintaining voter registration information, and systems are in place to track ballot delivery and return. The claim exaggerates the lack of knowledge about ballot destinations."
South Korea have spikes of Covid cases and nobody knows if they only had 300 deaths.,Not Correct,"The claim is not correct. South Korea experienced multiple waves of COVID-19, with a significantly higher death toll than 300. As of late 2023, South Korea has recorded over 22,000 COVID-19 related deaths."
Devender Sharma fabricated false covid-19 positive reports for patients  in order to get them admitted for kidney harvesting.,Not Correct,There is no credible evidence to support this claim.

There is a ‘global average’ for the number of judges and magistrates to number of people,Correct,"While a single, universally agreed-upon ""global average"" doesn't exist due to variations in legal systems and data collection, data *does* exist and is used to calculate ratios of judges/magistrates to population in various countries, allowing for the concept of a global average to be derived, even if it's an approximation."
"Michigan Senator Gary Peters is known for doing nothing, where he has skipped 84% of small business hearings and 89% of hearings on China.",Not Correct,"The claim is misleading and likely inaccurate. While Senator Peters may have missed a significant percentage of hearings, the claim doesn't provide context on *why* he missed them (e.g., scheduling conflicts, participation in other relevant activities) and presents a potentially biased interpretation of his engagement. Without further verification of the data and context, it's difficult to definitively say the claim is factually accurate."
Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta said that health experts had “indicated that levels of the positivity rate countrywide have fallen from a high of 13% in June to 8% in August” and described this as “very encouraging”.,Correct,"The claim accurately reflects statements made by President Uhuru Kenyatta regarding the decline in COVID-19 positivity rates in Kenya, as reported in August 2021."

COVID-19 cases in the Baranguay UP campus increased due to the SONAgkaisa rally held there on July 27 2020.,Not Correct,"While a SONAgkaisa rally occurred at the Baranguay UP campus on July 27, 2020, there is no definitive evidence to factually support the claim that the increase in COVID-19 cases was *due to* the rally. Correlation does not equal causation, and other factors could have contributed to the increase."

United States citizens don't get what they're looking to give illegal immigrants.",Not Correct,"The claim is misleading. While some undocumented immigrants may receive certain federal programs, it's not a blanket ""welfare benefits"" provision under Biden's policy. Eligibility is complex and varies by program. Furthermore, the statement that U.S. citizens don't get what they want to give is a generalization and not a direct consequence of Biden's policy. Many U.S. citizens *do* receive benefits, and the focus of policy debates often revolves around resource allocation, not a direct denial based on undocumented status."

Video claims Hindu ancient temples were found after Muslims' homes were demolished during construction of Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in India.,Not Correct,"The claim is a disputed narrative often promoted by Hindu nationalist groups. While the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project involved demolition of homes, there is no verified, factual evidence that ancient Hindu temples were *found* as a direct result of this demolition. The claim is largely considered a piece of misinformation used to promote a specific political viewpoint."

The F.D.A. did not say that hydroxychloroquine should not be used outside of a hospital setting or outside of a research study,Not Correct,The FDA *did* issue warnings against the off-label use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 outside of hospital settings or research studies due to a lack of proven efficacy and potential for serious side effects.
"The only survey showing negative results from the use of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive treatment against COVID-19 was one of very old, almost dead people.",Not Correct,"The claim is not accurate. Multiple studies, not just one involving older individuals, showed negative results regarding hydroxychloroquine's effectiveness as a COVID-19 preventative. While some studies focused on vulnerable populations, the lack of efficacy was a consistent finding across various investigations."
US President Donald Trump is morbidly obese.,Not Correct,"While Donald Trump's weight has been publicly discussed, the claim of him being ""morbidly obese"" is not definitively factually correct. Obesity is defined by a Body Mass Index (BMI), and there is no publicly available, verified BMI calculation confirming he meets that criteria. The statement is an opinionated characterization, not a confirmed medical diagnosis."
House of Representatives revoked the passage of the Media network ABS-CBN Franchise Bill on second reading in the Philipines.,Not Correct,The House of Representatives did not revoke the passage of the ABS-CBN Franchise Bill on second reading.

"Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will be harmed or killed by his coronavirus vaccines",Not Correct,"Bill Gates has **not** admitted that 700,000 people will be harmed or killed by his coronavirus vaccines.

A picture of a notice issued by Bulandshahr Police states that people have been punished for feeding migrant people have been punished for feeding migrant labourers.,Not Correct,"While there may be reports of punishments related to migrant worker assistance in Bulandshahr, the claim that a notice *issued by Bulandshahr Police* explicitly states people have been punished for feeding migrant laborers is not verifiable and likely inaccurate. There is no readily available, confirmed official notice from the Bulandshahr Police with that specific wording."
India has gone through the entire three months without a single person starving.,Not Correct,"This claim is not correct. India has experienced significant food insecurity and hunger, and while precise, real-time data for the entire country is difficult to obtain, reports indicate that hunger and undernourishment persist, and starvation does occur. The claim of zero starvation for three months is demonstrably false."
Hydroxychloroquine cures Covid-19.,Not Correct,"Hydroxychloroquine has been studied as a potential treatment for COVID-19, but clinical trials have shown it is not effective in preventing COVID-19 or curing COVID-19. Regulatory bodies like the FDA have not authorized it for this use due to lack of efficacy."
"Chinese are not taking any medicine or vaccine of coronavirus and are treating themselves at their homes with heat. They take hot steam, do hot gargles, and have hot tea four times a day each. This kills the virus in 4 days and they are free of coronavirus on 5th day.",Not Correct,"The claim is not correct. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that heat treatments like steam, gargles, and hot tea can cure COVID-19 within 4 days. While traditional practices may be used for symptom relief, they are not a proven treatment for the virus. Official medical treatments and vaccines are necessary for effective management and prevention of COVID-19."
"Journalists in China, Singapore and the UK and US, can only operate if they obtain government-issued press passes.",Not Correct,"While press passes are required for many journalistic activities in China, Singapore, and the UK/US, the claim that *all* journalists *must* obtain them to operate is not entirely accurate. In the UK and US, while press passes can be helpful, they are not universally required to practice journalism. In China and Singapore, government regulation is more pervasive, making it harder to operate without permission, but the claim doesn't fully encompass the nuances of each country's media landscape."
New Coronavirus antibody tests by Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche are 100% accurate.,Not Correct,"No antibody test is 100% accurate. All tests, including those by Roche, have a degree of false positives and false negatives. Accuracy rates vary depending on the test and conditions."

"Billionaire currency speculator George Soros has hailed the Covid-19 pandemic as the crisis of his lifetime, all but salivating over the chance to remake society amid the revolutionary moment he claims preceded the virus.",Not Correct,"The claim is a misrepresentation and likely a distortion of George Soros's statements. While Soros has discussed the pandemic as a significant global event with potential for societal change, the phrasing ""salivating over the chance to remake society"" is a highly charged, inflammatory, and likely inaccurate interpretation. There is no factual basis for the claim that he ""preceded"" the virus in any relevant way."
The United States is unmatched and unrivalled in its coronavirus testing capacity.,Not Correct,"While the U.S. has a significant testing infrastructure, data indicates other countries have, at times, surpassed the U.S. in testing rates per capita, particularly during different phases of the pandemic.

He advocated for blended learning models, not the complete elimination of physical classrooms."

They help protect against influenza viruses, and while a mild, non-influenza infection can occur after vaccination (a coincidental infection), it does not increase vulnerability to the flu."
The Katyn plaques were removed because the mass executions of Polish POWs 30 years ago in Russia didn't happen.,Not Correct,"The Katyn plaques were not removed because the mass executions didn't happen; they were removed due to a shift in political narratives and historical interpretations, particularly after the collapse of the Soviet Union and increased Polish-Russian cooperation in studying the event.

Thrombosis is a significant complication, but not the primary cause of death."
"A mixture of aspirin, honey, and lemon juice attacks COVID-19 and cures coronavirus.",Not Correct,"There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that a mixture of aspirin, honey, and lemon juice can attack or cure COVID-19 or coronavirus. This is a false and potentially dangerous claim."
"$3 trillion for federal coronavirus stimulus packages is ""being borrowed basically from China.""",Not Correct,"The claim is misleading. While the U.S. government borrowed money to fund the stimulus packages, the source of that borrowing was primarily domestic investors (including U.S. citizens, institutions, and foreign governments holding U.S. debt) within the U.S. market, not specifically China. The U.S. Treasury issues bonds to raise funds, and these are purchased by a diverse range of investors."

There are about 36,000 automotive deaths per year, as compared to 36 so far this year [13 March 2020] for COVID-19.",Not Correct,"The claim is not entirely accurate due to the incomplete COVID-19 data provided. While the comparison is intended to highlight the relative risk, the 36 COVID-19 deaths figure is likely an underestimation, as the pandemic continued to cause deaths beyond March 13, 2020. The claim is misleading because it uses incomplete data to support its point."

While he has criticized the current government's policies and compared them unfavorably to the UPA era, the specific phrasing of ""embraced weak UPA policies"" is not supported by verifiable reports."
A PPE shipment was destroyed at the Port of Dover after illegal immigrants were found travelling alongside it,Not Correct,"While there have been reports of PPE shipments being damaged at Dover, there is no confirmed, factual reporting that the destruction was *because* of illegal immigrants being found with the shipment. The claim implies a direct causal link not supported by verifiable evidence."
5G plays a part in this ‘plandemic’” The cases of COVID-19 are “directly related to electromagnetic radiation exposure by 5G,Not Correct,"This claim is a conspiracy theory and is not supported by scientific evidence. Extensive research has found no link between 5G and COVID-19. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, and the spread is related to respiratory droplets, not electromagnetic radiation."
COVIDsafe app “hidden” rules could allow workplaces and supermarkets to bar people who haven’t installed the program on their phone.,Correct,"Reports indicated that the COVIDsafe app had features that could be used to restrict access to certain venues, including workplaces and supermarkets, for those without the app. While the app's use is no longer mandated, the capability to implement such restrictions existed."

This is a false and potentially harmful claim. The Coronavirus is a virus, and this combination lacks antiviral properties."
Virtually no-one could have predicted that COVID-19 would spread exponentially in the U.S from February 2020 to May 2020.,Not Correct,"While the precise exponential spread was likely unexpected, many experts and models *did* predict a rapid spread of a novel respiratory virus, albeit perhaps not the *degree* of exponential growth observed in the U.S. during that period."
"Jack Ma said, ""2020 is not the year of thinking about your dreams or plans, but just to ensure that you stay alive""",Correct,"This quote is accurately attributed to Jack Ma, and it reflects his comments made in 2020 regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic."

"The CDC made 30,000 COVID-19 Deaths Disappear",Not Correct,"The claim is a misrepresentation of data adjustments. The CDC did *not* make COVID-19 deaths ""disappear."" They adjusted the data to remove duplicate deaths and to reflect updated reporting methods, leading to a lower reported number of deaths compared to initial figures. This is a standard practice in data collection and analysis."

The CDC does not Recommend That People Who Are Healthy Wear Facemasks,Not Correct,"The CDC now recommends that people who are feeling well *may* wear a mask in certain situations, particularly in crowded indoor settings or if at high risk of severe illness.

The situation is complex and details are still emerging."

Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy were Assasinated for trying to end Federal reserve banking system.,Not Correct,"There is no factual basis to support the claim that Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy were assassinated for trying to end the Federal Reserve banking system. Lincoln was assassinated for his role in the Civil War and his stance on slavery, while Kennedy was assassinated due to political tensions related to the Cold War and his foreign policy. The Federal Reserve system was established in 1913, long after Lincoln's death, and its existence is not a known factor in either assassination."
"Without Donald Trump's China travel ban, millions would have died of coronavirus",Not Correct,"There is no factual basis to support the claim that Donald Trump's China travel ban prevented millions of coronavirus deaths. The ban's effectiveness is highly debated, and studies generally show it had limited impact on the virus's spread within the US and on global infection rates. The claim is misleading and not supported by evidence."
"In the USA Mosques have been allowed to remain open for services during Covid-19, while churches have not.",Not Correct,"The claim is not accurate. During the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA, both mosques and churches experienced varying restrictions, but it was not the case that mosques were consistently allowed to remain open while churches were not.

"Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said “No Hindu among those arrested in Palghar lynching incident"".",Not Correct,"While Home Minister Anil Deshmukh's statement might be accurate regarding the religious identity of those arrested, it doesn't negate the fact that the Palghar lynching incident involved victims who were Hindu.

"The Covid-19 virus is a miracle of miracles, a miracle of miracles! Children do not die, do not get ill, do not end up in intensive care up to 20 years old.""",Not Correct,"The claim is factually incorrect.

While the severity is generally lower in children compared to older adults, COVID-19 has resulted in hospitalizations and deaths in individuals up to 20 years old."
Quinine found in tonic water along with 50-100mg of zinc daily will kill COVID-19.,Not Correct,"There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that quinine and zinc in tonic water can kill COVID-19.

Official health organizations do not recommend this as a COVID-19 treatment."

While a significant number of senators did not support the specific version of the stimulus package that included direct payments, the claim that 42 Democratic senators *voted against sending direct payments* is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate. Many senators may have voted against the *overall* package, which included direct payments, due to disagreements on other provisions. The claim also misrepresents the role of Independents."
Keep the room temperature at 30-40 degrees Celsius to prevent COVID-19.,Not Correct,"Maintaining a room temperature of 30-40 degrees Celsius is not a proven preventative measure against COVID-19.

US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lied about the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 by combining the count with pneumonia and influenza fatalities.,Not Correct,"The CDC does not claim to have ""lied."" They initially categorized COVID-19 deaths as deaths *caused by* COVID-19, which included those with underlying conditions like pneumonia and influenza. This categorization was used early in the pandemic when testing was limited, and the data reflected the available information at the time. The methodology has been adjusted as testing became more widespread."
"The drug Diamox, often used as treatment for high-altitude sickness, can cure the Coronavirus.",Not Correct,Diamox is used to prevent altitude sickness by helping the body acclimatize.

"""The 1st Amendment comes before the 13th and 14th, and the Bible clearly approves of owning slaves"" stated David Green on Fox News this morning.",Not Correct,"The claim is not accurate on multiple fronts. First, the order of the amendments is incorrect; the 13th and 14th Amendments were ratified *after* the 1st Amendment. Second, the Bible's stance on slavery is complex and debated; while some passages were historically used to justify it, many other passages condemn it. Finally, David Green's specific statement on Fox News needs verification, but the combination of factual inaccuracies makes the claim as a whole incorrect."

While the Pirbright Institute did obtain a European patent (EP3172319B1) related to a coronavirus vaccine, the statement that it was ""funded by Bill Gates"" is misleading. The Pirbright Institute is a UK-based company that *collaborated* with the Gates Foundation on various vaccine development initiatives, but the patent's funding source isn't solely or primarily the Gates Foundation.

Li Wenliang's initial comments were about a novel virus, not a cure for COVID-19, and the claim of tea as a cure is inaccurate and not supported by credible sources."
Italy went against the WHO instruction of not performing autopsies on COVID-19 casualties.,Not Correct,"The claim is misleading. While there were initial reports of inconsistent practices regarding autopsies in Italy early in the pandemic, the WHO did *not* issue a blanket instruction *not* to perform autopsies. Instead, the WHO issued guidance advising countries to conduct autopsies where feasible to understand the virus's behavior, but acknowledged logistical challenges during the pandemic. Italy did conduct autopsies, though the extent and consistency of those practices were debated."

The first confirmed death was on January 20, 2020, while the public health emergency was declared on January 30, 2020. Therefore, public safety measures were in place before the first death, but not before the declaration."

There is no scientific evidence that aspirin, antihistamines, or nasal spray can cure COVID-19 or Coronavirus. This information is false and potentially dangerous. Zoology books primarily focus on animals, not human medicine or viral cures."
A zoology book authored by Dr Ramesh Gupta speaks of COVID-19 and The novel coronavirus (nCoV) or COVID-19 is not a new disease.,Not Correct,"The claim is not correct. While the book may discuss the history of viruses and coronaviruses, the statement that COVID-19 is ""not a new disease"" is factually inaccurate. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which was newly identified and caused a pandemic in 2020. Therefore, it is a relatively new disease."

While the current response to COVID-19 has achieved a high approval rating (though this is debatable depending on the poll), the claim that the H1N1 response was ""one of the worst on record"" is an oversimplification and not supported by a universally agreed-upon assessment. Furthermore, the comparison of approval ratings is misleading without specifying the timeframe and methodology of each approval rating.

"Hundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs, and China’s eating the cost.",Not Correct,"While tariffs are collected by the U.S. government, the claim that China ""eats the cost"" is misleading.

The claim overstates China's burden and understates the impact on the U.S."
China lost 3 million jobs as a result of the US-China trade war.,Not Correct,"While the US-China trade war likely impacted China's job market, the claim of a 3 million job loss is not consistently supported by data from reputable sources.

A new EU withdrawal bill allows the EU to choose the length of a further Brexit extension and the UK has no say in it.,Not Correct,"The claim is not entirely accurate. While the EU withdrawal bill gives the EU significant power to determine the length of a potential extension, the UK *does* have a say, as any extension would require agreement between the EU and the UK. The UK can negotiate the terms of the extension, although the EU holds the final decision-making power."

Donald Trump's fuel efficiency plan would reduce the cost of cars “by more than $3000” and make them “substantially safer.”,Not Correct,"The claim is not factually correct. While Trump proposed fuel efficiency standards, there is no reliable evidence to support a cost reduction of ""more than $3000"" and a guarantee of ""substantially safer"" vehicles as a direct result of that specific plan.

While it's true that few, if any, of the allegations resulted in successful court outcomes, many allegations *were* brought before the courts in Kenya in 2015, even if they weren't fully resolved or resulted in dismissals. The claim is misleading by implying no legal action occurred."
Kenya’s deputy president Ruto said “None of [the dropped ministers] even made it to court because the allegations that were made [against them] did not have any basis.”,Not Correct,"While Deputy President Ruto may have stated this, it is not factually accurate without further evidence.

Before you die, live.”",Not Correct,"The quote is attributed to William Shakespeare, but it is not a known or documented quote from his writings. It is a modern sentiment, likely misattributed."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said more than once that for settling the conflict in Donbass the most important thing is not dialogue with Moscow, because Moscow is not a party to this conflict. It is an intra-Ukrainian conflict and it is up to the Ukrainians to settle it, if they talk to each other.""",Not Correct,"The claim is not entirely accurate. While Putin has stated Moscow isn't a party to the conflict in the same way Ukraine is, Russia's actions (military intervention, support for separatists) demonstrate direct involvement, making the statement misleading. He has indeed emphasized the conflict is ""intra-Ukrainian"" and that a settlement depends on Ukrainian dialogue, but this is framed within the context of Russia's narrative and actions in the conflict."

"NATO Caused the Crisis in Libya with terrorism, weapons smuggling and illegal immigration beginning after the 2011 NATO intervention.",Not Correct,"The claim is a contentious one with no definitive factual consensus. While the 2011 NATO intervention destabilized Libya, attributing the subsequent crisis solely to NATO and claiming they *caused* terrorism, weapons smuggling, and illegal immigration is an oversimplification and not universally supported by evidence. These issues had pre-existing roots, and the intervention is one factor among many that contributed to the complex situation. The claim presents a biased and unsubstantiated causal link."

Transition rates are typically measured at different levels (primary, secondary), and while primary education has high enrollment, secondary transition rates were lower. Data from UNESCO and other sources indicate that while progress was made, a 100% transition across all levels in 2019 is not accurate."
Kenyatta administrations aggressive push of this [universal access to basic education] agenda has this year seen us achieve 100% transition rate.,Not Correct,"While Kenya has made significant strides in expanding access to education, a 100% transition rate is not accurate. Transition rates fluctuate and are often reported with caveats, and the claim likely overstates the reality.

However, the amount is indeed significant and confirms the claim's factual basis."
Since its inception 3.881 million tonnes of cargo have been transported on the standard-gauge railway line in Kenya,Correct,"This claim is likely correct, as Kenya Railways has reported significant cargo transport volumes on its standard-gauge railway line since its launch.

"Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, “Attorneys don’t know much about the law as lawyers do and Ben Shapiro is just an attorney. So, yeah.”",Not Correct,"This claim is a misrepresentation of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's statement. While she did criticize Ben Shapiro's legal expertise in a video, the claim inaccurately summarizes her entire statement and implies she made a broader, more definitive statement about attorneys' legal knowledge in general, which she did not. The claim also misrepresents Shapiro's profession; he is a lawyer, and the statement is a direct quote."
Since 1973 the income of the bottom 90% of Americans didn't budge.,Not Correct,"While the income of the bottom 90% has seen minimal growth since 1973, it *has* budged.

Nobody would have believed that was possible.",Not Correct,"While the U.S. has added jobs since Trump's election, the claim of 5.5 million new jobs, including 600,000 new manufacturing jobs, is an exaggeration and not fully supported by data.

"President Donald Trump will get full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which the program has been waiting 30 years for.",Not Correct,"While the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) has been around for many years, the claim that President Trump will get ""full funding"" of $300 million and that the program has been ""waiting 30 years"" is misleading. Funding levels for the GLRI fluctuate and haven't consistently reached a fixed $300 million. The program's history is more complex than simply ""waiting 30 years"" for full funding."
President Donald Trump revitalizing automobile industries that were decimated before he took office.,Not Correct,"While the auto industry experienced some recovery during Trump's presidency, the claim of ""revitalization"" of industries ""decimated"" *before* his term is an overstatement.

Australia's second Kyoto target required a 755 million tonne emissions reduction, and the Coalition government inherited a significant deficit in emissions reduction progress from the previous Labor government. The statement implies the previous government didn't adequately address emissions reduction, which is a matter of political interpretation but the deficit figure is accurate."

Donald trump claims that 'We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history',Correct,"Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that his administration enacted the largest tax cuts in American history, referring to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

We pay the bills. They get better. Everybody is happy. And we actually save a lot of money, if you can believe it. And I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved.",Not Correct,"The claim is misleading. While the VA Choice program exists and aims to provide healthcare access for veterans who don't qualify for VA healthcare, it has faced significant challenges and delays throughout its history. The statement exaggerates the ease of access and cost savings, and the claim of a 44-year struggle for approval is likely an oversimplification."
"Donald trump claims When the wind stops blowing, that’s the end of your electric (power)",Correct,"Donald Trump has indeed stated that wind power is unreliable and that when the wind isn't blowing, electricity generation from wind turbines ceases, implying a potential end of electric power.

"We have created ""5.3 million new jobs, including over, now, 600,000 beautiful, brand-new manufacturing jobs.""",Not Correct,"The claim is likely inaccurate. While job creation numbers fluctuate and are often revised, the specific figures provided (5.3 million new jobs and 600,000 new manufacturing jobs) are not readily supported by current, reliable data from official sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). It's highly probable the numbers are exaggerated or misstated."
Donald trump made claims about the veterans choice program being something that people has failed to create for four decades.,Not Correct,"While Donald Trump has made claims about the Veterans Choice Program, the assertion that it was ""something people has failed to create for four decades"" is inaccurate. The program was established in 2014, not after a 40-year failure to create a similar program. The program's creation was a result of legislative efforts, not a failure to create something previously."
Cancer is Candida or Fungus.,Not Correct,"Cancer is not caused by Candida or fungus. Cancer is a complex disease involving uncontrolled cell growth, primarily linked to genetic mutations, not fungal infections. While fungal infections can sometimes weaken the immune system in cancer patients, they do not *cause* cancer."
CORY AQUINO's Presidency of the Philippines is unconstitutional.,Not Correct,"Cory Aquino was constitutionally elected President of the Philippines, serving from 1986 to 1998.

"Trump promised during the campaign not to cut Social Security or Medicare, his proposed 2019 budget included cuts of $500 billion to Medicare and $72 billion to Social Security",Not Correct,"While Trump pledged to protect Social Security and Medicare, his 2019 budget proposal *did* include cuts to Medicare, though the stated cut was $50 billion, not $500 billion. The proposed budget also included cuts to Social Security, though the stated amount was $72 billion, not $72 billion. Therefore, the claim misstates the actual budget cuts proposed."
"In the United States right now, we have more income and wealth inequality than any other country on Earth.",Correct,The United States has a higher Gini coefficient for income inequality and wealth inequality compared to most other developed countries. Data consistently shows the US lags behind in these metrics globally.

This has been widely reported and documented."
Man who cited religious reasons for not paying his income taxes “has won a historic lawsuit against the IRS.”,Not Correct,"While the man won the lawsuit, the claim of it being a ""historic"" victory is subjective and potentially misleading.

The core of the case likely involved a specific interpretation of religious freedom, not a landmark ruling with widespread historical impact."
"Genetically modified yeast, animal, bacterial and viral DNA in vaccines can be incorporated into the recipient’s DNA causing unknown genetic mutations.",Not Correct,"While vaccines introduce genetic material (DNA or RNA, depending on the vaccine type), the claim that this material permanently integrates into the recipient's DNA and causes unknown mutations is not accurate. The genetic material from vaccines typically remains in the cell's cytoplasm and does not integrate into the host's DNA. Furthermore, rigorous safety testing is in place to ensure vaccines are safe and do not cause harmful mutations."

"Mercury (aka thimerosal or thiomersal) is in vaccines and can damage the brain, gut, liver, bone marrow, nervous system, and kidneys. It is linked to autoimmune disorders, including autism.",Not Correct,"The claim is not supported by scientific evidence.

Extensive research has found no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism or other autoimmune disorders."
"Farmers are declaring bankruptcy ""in record numbers"" and ""the median income for U.S. farm households was -$1,548 in 2018.""",Correct,Both statements are factually accurate. USDA data confirms increasing farm bankruptcies and a negative median income for U.S. farm households in 2018.

Former President Barack Obama would have gone to war with North Korea.,Not Correct,"There is no factual basis to definitively state that Barack Obama *would have* gone to war with North Korea. While tensions were high during his presidency, a military conflict was not initiated. The claim is speculative and lacks verifiable evidence of a definitive decision to pursue war."
President Obama put more debt on the USA than any president in the history of our country combined.,Not Correct,"This claim is not accurate. The national debt increased significantly during Obama's presidency, but it's not true that he added more debt than all previous presidents combined. Historical data shows the total debt accumulation is a result of many factors across multiple administrations."
"When countries put people into the diversity visa lottery program, they’re putting some very bad people in the lottery",Not Correct,"The claim is an opinion, not a factual statement. The diversity visa lottery is designed to promote diversity, and there's no factual basis to assert that it intentionally includes ""bad people."" The lottery is a random selection process."
"A big majority of the big drugs, the big drug loads, don't go through ports of entry. They can't go through ports of entry.",Not Correct,"While a significant amount of drugs *do* enter through ports of entry, the claim that ""a big majority"" *don't* is not accurate.

Chain migration refers to when immigrants are able to join relatives who have already immigrated, which is not what happened with Saipov. He immigrated independently, and his actions do not fit the definition of chain migration."
Drug loads can't enter the US through US ports of entry.,Not Correct,"While there are strict regulations and efforts to prevent drug smuggling, the claim is not entirely accurate. Drug loads *do* enter the US through ports of entry, though often illegally.

"In China, a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty. Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called, how about a fine?",Correct,"China has a death penalty for serious drug offenses, and fines are also a form of punishment, though the death penalty carries more severe consequences. The statement accurately reflects both aspects."
US President Obama was ready to have gone to war with North Korea.,Not Correct,"There is no factual basis to support the claim that President Obama was ""ready to have gone to war"" with North Korea. While tensions existed, the Obama administration pursued a strategy of diplomacy and sanctions, not a readiness for war."
"The US has chain migration, where a family member can bring in 20+ people and that is what happened on the West Side highway. A young man killed eight people and brought in many people because of chain migration.",Not Correct,"The claim contains inaccuracies. While the US has a chain migration system, the assertion that a family member can bring in 20+ people is a significant exaggeration and not an accurate description of the process. Furthermore, the claim links chain migration to the West Side Highway incident and the perpetrator bringing in many people *because* of it, which is factually incorrect and a misrepresentation of the events. The perpetrator's motivations are complex and not solely attributable to chain migration."

"You have chain migration. Where a bad person comes in, brings 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members, because he has his mother, his grandmother, sister, cousin, uncle. They are all in. You know what happened on the west side highway? That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people... He had many people brought in because he was in the United States.",Not Correct,"The claim contains a mix of factual inaccuracies and potentially misleading information. While chain migration does occur, the specific details provided (regarding the West Side Highway incident and the number of family members brought in) are not accurate representations of how immigration and criminal activity relate. The claim also relies on generalizations and potentially harmful stereotypes."

Mississippi passed the 5-71-226 Anti-Youth Subversion Act banning talking to minors about atheist Richard Dawkins.,Not Correct,"The claim is not accurate. There is no evidence that Mississippi passed a law with that specific name (5-71-226) banning discussion of Richard Dawkins. While Mississippi passed a law restricting sex education, it does not specifically target atheist figures like Richard Dawkins. The claim appears to be misinformation."

"There were 1,200 murders in 2018 in Juarez, Mexico compared with 23 just across the border in El Paso, Texas, US, due to the construction of the border fence.",Not Correct,"The claim is not accurate. While Juarez experienced a high murder rate in 2018, the number of murders in Juarez was approximately 800, not 1,200. El Paso's murder rate was significantly lower than Juarez's, and there's no definitive evidence to support the claim that the border fence *caused* the disparity."

The railway has been in the books of our government for 30 years – it was not built,Not Correct,"The claim is likely not correct. Railway projects are typically planned, funded, and constructed over time, making a 30-year presence in government records strongly suggests *some* level of planning or funding, even if full construction hasn't occurred. The statement implies no action was taken, which is improbable."
The standard gauge railway has been in the books of the Kenyan government for 30 years but it was not built.,Correct,"The claim is factually correct. There is documented evidence that plans for a standard gauge railway in Kenya existed for approximately 30 years before construction began, but implementation faced delays."

"We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs.",Correct,"The claim aligns with data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) regarding job growth, including a significant increase in manufacturing jobs."
Wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living in America.,Correct,"Data from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Economic Policy Institute consistently show that wage growth has not kept up with increases in the cost of essential goods and services (housing, food, healthcare, etc.) in the United States over the past several years."
"Since the Republican tax cuts became law, manufacturing plants are closing, layoffs are looming, and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living.",Not Correct,"The claim presents a correlation (tax cuts and economic hardship) without definitively proving causation. While some manufacturing closures and wage stagnation occurred during this period, attributing them *solely* to the tax cuts is an oversimplification. Other economic factors likely contributed.

Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country.",Not Correct,"While El Paso has made strides in reducing crime, the claim is misleading. Crime rates have decreased significantly, but the statement exaggerates the historical severity (""extremely high rates...one of the highest"") and directly links the barrier's construction to the current safety, implying a direct causal relationship that is debatable and not definitively proven. El Paso is not universally considered one of the safest cities in the country."

Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades with President Donald Trump in 2019.,Not Correct,"While wages did rise in 2019, the claim that they rose at the *fastest pace in decades* specifically *with President Donald Trump* is misleading and not fully supported by data.

More accurate data indicates a significant land concentration, but not at the stated proportions."
The post-1994 governments have cumulatively bought less than 7% of the targeted 30% of land meant for redistribution over a period of 25 years.,Correct,"This claim accurately reflects data regarding land redistribution in post-1994 South Africa.

The German press launched a massive campaign to discredit Russian and Russian language media.,Correct,"Multiple reports indicate a coordinated effort by German media outlets to highlight and amplify criticisms of Russian media, often framing it as state-controlled propaganda, particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine.

While Mitch McConnell has received donations from individuals with ties to Russia, the statement that the ""biggest donor is the Russian oligarch that the GOP controlled Congress just lifted sanctions on"" is factually incorrect. No such sanctions were lifted by a GOP-controlled Congress regarding a single Russian oligarch as the primary source of McConnell's funding.

Every country in the world that wants to undergo serious development borrows money.

**Toward a Unified Stress Testing Framework for Large Language Models in NLP**

## 📄 Abstract  
As large language models (LLMs) become foundational tools across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks boosting business growth, product development, and clinical reporting their robustness, fairness, and reliability under diverse conditions are increasingly critical.  

Current evaluation methods lack a unified framework for systematically testing these models. Most rely on handcrafted adversarial inputs or human feedback loops, which are limited in scalability and prone to individual bias. Additionally, task-specific metrics hinder generalization across domains, leading to fragmented and non-comparable evaluations.  

Vulnerability testing is a key pathway to AI explainability, helping illuminate the opaque decision-making processes of LLMs under stress. By exposing behavioral vulnerabilities, we enhance interpretability and gain insights into internal mechanisms that remain hidden during normal operation.  

This project identifies limitations in current stress-testing methodologies and proposes principles for a standardized, automated framework that evaluates LLMs across diverse reasoning tasks minimizing human-induced subjectivity and maximizing interpretability.

Despite rapid advancements in LLMs, their behavior remains highly context-dependent. The diversity in model architectures, training data, and applications introduces variability that makes inconsistencies in task execution expected.  

Current evaluation approaches are often domain-specific, limiting their generalizability. Most stress-testing efforts rely on adversarial prompts to expose vulnerabilities such as bias, hallucinations, or ethical failures. Hallucinations, where models generate plausible but untrue responses—are common, driven by the model’s objective to produce fluent output even without factual grounding.  

While techniques like retrieval augmented generation (RAG), fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and output verification have reduced hallucination rates, manual testing remains non-reproducible and biased. Human-in-the-loop evaluations introduce subjectivity, complicating cross-study comparisons.  

This fragmented landscape underscores the need for a unified, interpretable, and scalable stress-testing framework that can systematically probe LLM behavior across tasks and domains.
